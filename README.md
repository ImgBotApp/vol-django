# Vol::Django

Welcome! This project is in very early and experimental stage, and help in the following areas would be greatly appreciated!

This repository contains the site prototype, it's a fairly standard Django setup with Bootstrap.

How you could help:
* Someone who would like to add support for new countries, or a Python dev who loves crawler the web? We are also looking for help writing crawlers, have a look at <a href="github.com/volCommunity/vol-crawlers">vol-crawlers</a>.
* Designers: Please help this site look better!
* Front end or full stack developers with an opinion on how to make things better: feel free to look at or raise issues or PRs.
