        <p>This site was made to scratch my own itch. In my experience most sites to find volunteering opportunities
            are demotivating instead of uplifting.</p>
        <p>
            I came across terribly cluttered UI experiences while looking for volunteering opportunities in Amsterdam, The
            Netherlands
            a few years ago, from a company perspective, found the same to be true in Sydney, Australia, while on a
            sabbatical the same seems to hold true for New Zealand. </p>

        <p>So here I am being the change I seek! I'm not a frontend dev nor designer and by no means claim it looks
            good, but at
            least you'll be able to connect to charities quicker. If you want to help out improving this project,
            check out the
            <a href="/collaborate.html">collaboration page</a>!</p>
